// To create a prefab, you can create an entity with the Prefab tag:
SpaceShip :- Prefab

// Alternatively you can use the shorthand declaration syntax which has the same
// result, and allows you to open a scope after the statement:
Prefab SpaceShip {
  Attack: {50}
  Defense: {50}
}

// To create a prefab that inherits from SpaceShip, we can use the : operator
Prefab Freighter : SpaceShip {
  Defense: {100}
}

// We can create a prefab instance with the same : operator.
my_spaceship : Freighter {
  Attack: {75} // Override component from SpaceShip
}
