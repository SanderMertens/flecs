/* Instancing is the ability of queries to iterate results with fields that have
 * different numbers of elements. The term "instancing" is borrowed from 
 * graphics APIs, where it means reusing the same data for multiple "instances".
 * 
 * Query instancing works in much the same way. By default queries match all
 * components on the same entity. It is however possible to request data from
 * other entities, like getting the Position from the entity's parent.
 * 
 * Instancing refers to the ability of queries to iterate components for 
 * multiple entities while at the same time providing "instanced" components,
 * which are always provided one element at a time.
 * 
 * Instancing is often used in combination with parent-child relationships and
 * prefabs, but is applicable to any kind of query where some of the terms are
 * matched on N entities, and some on a single entity.
 * 
 * By default queries are not instanced, which means that if a result contains
 * mixed fields, entities will be iterated one by one instead of in batches.
 * This is safer, as code doesn't have to do anything different for owned and
 * shared fields, but does come at a performance penalty.
 * 
 * The each() iterator function always uses an instanced iterator under the
 * hood. This is transparent to the application, but improves performance. For
 * this reason using each() can be faster than using uninstanced iter().
