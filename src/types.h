 * the 'parent' member in the EcsPrefab component, for the child entity of the
 * prefab. This acts as a front-end for another mechanism, that ensures that
 * child entities for different prefab parents are added to different tables. As
 * a result of setting a parent in EcsPrefab, Flecs will:
 * 
 *  - Add the prefab to the entity type
 *  - Find or create a prefab parent flag entity
 *  - Set the EcsPrefabParent component on the prefab parent flag entity
 *  - Add the prefab parent flag entity to the child
 * 
 * The last step ensures that the type of the child entity is associated with at
 * most one prefab parent. If the mechanism would just rely on the EcsPrefab
 * parent field, it would theoretically be possible that childs for different
 * prefab parents end up in the same table.

/** A column system is a system that is ran periodically (default = every frame)
 * on all entities that match the system signature expression. Column systems
 * are prematched with tables (archetypes) that match the system signature
 * expression. Each time a column system is invoked, it iterates over the 
 * matched list of tables (the 'tables' member). 
 *
 * For each table, the system stores a list of the components that were matched
 * with the system. This list may differ from the component list of the table,
 * when OR expressions or optional expressions are used.
 * 
 * A column system keeps track of tables that are empty. These tables are stored
 * in the 'inactive_tables' array. This prevents the system from iterating over
 * tables in the main loop that have no data.
 * 
 * For each table, a column system stores an index that translates between the
 * a column in the system signature, and the matched table. This information is
 * stored, alongside with an index that identifies the table, in the 'tables'
 * member. This is an array of an array of integers, per table.
 * 
 * Additionally, the 'tables' member contains information on where a component
 * should be fetched from. By default, components are fetched from an entity,
 * but a system may specify that a component must be resolved from a container,
 * or must be fetched from a prefab. In this case, the index to lookup a table
 * column from system column contains a negative number, which identifies an
 * element in the 'refs' array.
 * 
 * The 'refs' array contains elements of type 'EcsRef', and stores references
 * to external entities. References can vary per table, but not per entity/row,
 * as prefabs / containers are part of the entity type, which in turn 
 * identifies the table in which the entity is stored.
 * 
 * The 'period' and 'time_passed' members are used for periodic systems. An
 * application may specify that a system should only run at a specific interval, 
 * like once per second. This interval is stored in the 'period' member. Each
 * time the system is evaluated but not ran, the delta_time is added to the 
 * time_passed member, until it exceeds 'period'. In that case, the system is
 * ran, and 'time_passed' is decreased by 'period'.
