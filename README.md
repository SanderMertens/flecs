Flecs is a fast and lightweight Entity Component System with a focus on high performance game development and usability ([join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/MRSAZqb)). The highlights of the framework are:

- Zero dependency C99 core, modern type safe C++11 API, no dependencies on STL types
- Batched iteration with direct access to component arrays
- SoA/Archetype storage for efficient CPU caching & vectorization
- Automatic component registration across binaries
- Runtime tags
- Hierarchies
- Prefabs
- Relationships graphs & graph queries
- Thread safe, lockless API
- Systems that are ran manually, every frame or at a time/rate interval
- Queries that can be iterated from free functions
- Modules for organizing components & systems
- Builtin statistics & introspection
- Modular core with compile-time disabling of optional features
- A dashboard module for visualizing statistics:

**This is a v3 alpha release! All of the usual QA is applied to master, but API changes may occur!**
For the last stable version, use [Flecs v2.4.6](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/releases/tag/v2.4.6).

## What is an Entity Component System?
ECS (Entity Component System) is a design pattern used in games and simulations that produces fast and reusable code. Dynamic composition is a first-class citizen in ECS, and there is a strict separation between data and behavior. A framework is an Entity Component System if it:

- Has _entities_ that are unique identifiers
- Has _components_ that are plain data types
- Has _systems_ which are behavior matched with entities based on their components

## Examples
This is a simple flecs example in the C99 API:

```c
typedef struct {
  float x, y;
} Position, Velocity;

void Move(ecs_iter_t *it) {
  Position *p = ecs_term(it, Position, 1);
  Velocity *v = ecs_term(it, Velocity, 2);
  
  for (int i = 0; i < it->count; i ++) {
    p[i].x += v[i].x;
    p[i].y += v[i].y;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  ecs_world_t *ecs = ecs_init();

  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Position);
  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Velocity);

  ECS_SYSTEM(ecs, Move, EcsOnUpdate, Position, Velocity);

  ecs_entity_t e = ecs_new_id(ecs);
  ecs_set(ecs, e, Position, {10, 20});
  ecs_set(ecs, e, Velocity, {1, 2});

  ecs_iter_t it = ecs_term_iter(world, &(ecs_term_t) { ecs_id(Position) });
  while (ecs_term_next(&it)) {
    Position *p = ecs_term(&it, Position, 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < it.count; i ++) {
      printf("{%f, %f}\n", p[i].x, p[i].y);
    }
  }

  while (ecs_progress(ecs, 0)) { }
}
```

This is the same example in the C++11 API:

```c++
struct Position {
  float x, y;
};

struct Velocity {
  float x, y;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  flecs::world ecs;

  ecs.system<Position, const Velocity>()
    .each([](Position& p, const Velocity& v) {
      p.x += v.x;
      p.y += v.y;
    });

  auto e = ecs.entity()
    .set([](Position& p, Velocity& v) {
      p = {10, 20};
      v = {1, 2};
    });

  ecs.each([](flecs::entity e, Position& p) {
    std::cout << "{" << p.x << ", " << p.y << "}" << std::endl;
  });
    
  while (ecs.progress()) { }
}
```

The first C example used macro's to emulate a type-safe layer on top of the
underlying generic API. This example shows the C API without macro's:

```c
// Register the Position component
ecs_entity_t pos = ecs_component_init(ecs, &(ecs_component_desc_t){
  .entity.name = "Position",
  .size = sizeof(Position), .alignment = ECS_ALIGNOF(Position)
});

// Register the Velocity component
ecs_entity_t vel = ecs_component_init(ecs, &(ecs_component_desc_t){
  .entity.name = "Velocity",
  .size = sizeof(Velocity), .alignment = ECS_ALIGNOF(Velocity)
});

// Create the Move system
ecs_system_init(ecs, &(ecs_system_desc_t){
  .entity = { .name = "Move", .add = {EcsOnUpdate} },
  .query.filter.terms = {{pos}, {vel, .inout = EcsIn}},
  .callback = Move,
});

// Create entity
ecs_entity_t e = ecs_new_id(ecs);

// Set components
ecs_set_id(ecs, e, pos, sizeof(Position), &(Position){10, 20});
ecs_set_id(ecs, e, vel, sizeof(Velocity), &(Velocity){1, 2});
```

## Building
The easiest way to add Flecs to a project is to add [flecs.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.c) and [flecs.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.h) to your source code. These files can be added to both C and C++ projects (the C++ API is embedded in flecs.h). Alternatively you can also build Flecs as a library by using the cmake, meson, bazel or bake buildfiles.

### Custom builds
The Flecs source has a modular design which makes it easy to strip out code you don't need. At its core, Flecs is a minimalistic ECS library with a lot of optional features that you can choose to include or not. [This section of the manual](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/blob/master/docs/Manual.md#custom-builds) describes how to customize which features to include. 

## Software Quality
To ensure stability of Flecs, the code is thoroughly tested on every commit:

- More than 2400 testcases and 60.000 lines of test code
- Over 90% code coverage
- All tests run without memory leaks & memory corruption
- All examples are compiled warning free

The code is validated on the following platforms/compilers:

- **Windows**
  - msvc
- **Ubuntu**
  - gcc 7, 8, 9, 10
  - clang 8, 9
- **MacOS**
  - gcc 10
  - clang 9

### API stability
APIs are stable between minor and patch versions, but exceptions are made in these scenarios:
- The design of an API prevents it from being used without introducing bugs
- The design of an API is prone to misuse or confusing

The following parts of the API are not stable between patch/minor versions:
- Anything in include/private
- The ABI is not guaranteed to be stable, so a recompile of code is required after upgrading

Functions may become deprecated before a major release. To build flecs without deprecated functions, exclude the `FLECS_DEPRECATED` addon. (see [custom builds](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/blob/master/docs/Manual.md#custom-builds)).
