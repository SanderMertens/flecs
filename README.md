Flecs is a fast and lightweight Entity Component System that lets you build games and simulations with millions of entities ([join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/BEzP5Rgrrp)). Here are some of the framework's highlights:

- Fast and [portable](#language-bindings) zero dependency [C99 API](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/group__c.html)
- Modern type-safe [C++11 API](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/group__cpp.html) that doesn't use STL containers
- First open source ECS with full support for [Entity Relationships](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/md_docs_2Relationships.html)!
- Fast native support for [hierarchies](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/md_docs_2Relationships.html#the-childof-relationship) and [prefabs](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/md_docs_2Relationships.html#the-isa-relationship)
- Code base that builds in less than 5 seconds
- Runs [in the browser](https://flecs.dev/city) without modifications with emscripten
- Cache friendly [archetype/SoA storage](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/building-an-ecs-2-archetypes-and-vectorization-fe21690805f9) that can process millions of entities every frame
- Automatic component registration that works out of the box across shared libraries/DLLs
- Write free functions with [queries](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/queries/basics) or run code automatically in [systems](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/systems/pipeline)
- Run games on multiple CPU cores with a fast lockless scheduler
- Verified on all major compilers and platforms with [CI](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/actions) running more than 10000 tests
- Integrated [reflection framework](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/group__c__addons__meta.html) with [JSON serializer](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/basics_json) and support for [runtime components](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/runtime_component)
- [Unit annotations](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/units) for components
- Powerful [query language](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/queries) with support for [joins](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/queries/setting_variables) and [inheritance](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/queries/component_inheritance)
- [Statistics addon](https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/group__c__addons__stats.html) for profiling ECS performance
- A web-based UI for monitoring & controlling your apps:

## What is an Entity Component System?
ECS is a way of organizing code and data that lets you build games that are larger, more complex and are easier to extend. Something is called an ECS when it:
- Has _entities_ that uniquely identify objects in a game
- Has _components_ which are datatypes that can be added to entities
- Has _systems_ which are functions that run for all entities matching a component _query_

For more information, check the [ECS FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq)!

## Show me the code!
C99 example:
```c
typedef struct {
  float x, y;
} Position, Velocity;

void Move(ecs_iter_t *it) {
  Position *p = ecs_field(it, Position, 0);
  Velocity *v = ecs_field(it, Velocity, 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < it->count; i++) {
    p[i].x += v[i].x;
    p[i].y += v[i].y;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  ecs_world_t *ecs = ecs_init();

  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Position);
  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Velocity);

  ECS_SYSTEM(ecs, Move, EcsOnUpdate, Position, Velocity);

  ecs_entity_t e = ecs_insert(ecs, 
    ecs_value(Position, {10, 20}),
    ecs_value(Velocity, {1, 2}));

  while (ecs_progress(ecs, 0)) { }
}
```

Same example in C++11:

```cpp
struct Position {
  float x, y;
};

struct Velocity {
  float x, y;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  flecs::world ecs;

  ecs.system<Position, const Velocity>()
    .each([](Position& p, const Velocity& v) {
      p.x += v.x;
      p.y += v.y;
    });

  auto e = ecs.entity()
    .insert([](Position& p, Velocity& v) {
      p = {10, 20};
      v = {1, 2};
    });

  while (ecs.progress()) { }
}
```

### [Hytale](https://hytale.com/)
[![Hytale](docs/img/projects/hytale.png)](https://hytale.com/)

> We knew that we wanted to build Hytale around an Entity-Component-System (ECS). When we analyzed the options, FLECS rose to the top. FLECS provides the backbone of the Hytale Game Engine. Its flexibility has allowed us to build highly varied gameplay while supporting our vision for empowering Creators.
