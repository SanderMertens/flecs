Flecs is a fast and lightweight [Entity Component System](#what-is-an-entity-component-system) for C89 / C99 / C++11 that packs a lot of punch in a small footprint:

- Blazing fast iteration speeds with direct access to raw C arrays across multiple components
- Built-in support for entity hierarchies, prefabs, nested prefabs and prefab variants
- An efficient lock-free staging architecture allows for modifying entities across multiple threads
- Expressive entity queries with support for and, or, not and optional operators
- Systems that are time triggered, rate triggered, run every frame or run only when needed
- Modules enable organizing systems & components in reusable plug & play units
- A customizable core that makes it easy to integrate Flecs into other frameworks / game engines

This is Flecs v2, which is a breaking change from v1. For the last v1 release, see:
https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/releases/tag/v1.3

## What is an Entity Component System?
ECS (Entity Component System) is a way to organize code that is mostly used in gaming and simulation projects. ECS code generally performs better than traditional OOP, and is typically easier to reuse. The main differences between ECS and OOP are composition is a first class citizen in ECS, and that data is represented as plain data types rather than encapsulated classes.  A framework is an Entity Component System if it:

- Has _entities_ that are unique identifiers (integers)
- Has _components_ that are plain data types which can be added to entities
- Has _systems_ that are functions which are matched against entities with a set of components

## Example
This is a simple flecs example in the C99 and C++11 APIs:

```c
typedef struct Position {
    float x;
    float y;
} Position;

typedef float Speed;

void Move(ecs_iter_t *it) {
    Position *p = ecs_column(it, Position, 1);
    Speed *s = ecs_column(it, Speed, 2);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < it->count; i ++) {
        p[i].x += s[i] * it->delta_time;
        p[i].y += s[i] * it->delta_time;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ecs_world_t *world = ecs_init();

    ECS_COMPONENT(world, Position);
    ECS_COMPONENT(world, Speed);
    ECS_SYSTEM(world, Move, EcsOnUpdate, Position, Speed);

    ecs_entity_t e = ecs_new(world, 0);    
    ecs_set(world, e, Position, {0, 0});
    ecs_set(world, e, Speed, {1});
    
    while (ecs_progress(world, 0));

    return ecs_fini(world);
}
```

```c++
struct Position {
    float x;
    float y;
};

struct Speed {
    float value;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    flecs::world world;

    flecs::component<Position>(world, "Position");
    flecs::component<Speed>(world, "Speed");

    flecs::system<Position, Speed>(world)
        .each([](flecs::entity e, Position& p, Speed& s) {
            p.x += s.value * e.delta_time();
            p.y += s.value * e.delta_time();
        });

    flecs::entity(world, "MyEntity")
        .set<Position>({0, 0})
        .set<Speed>({1});

    while (world.progress()) { }
}
```
