Flecs is a fast and lightweight Entity Component System that lets you build games and simulations with millions of entities ([join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/BEzP5Rgrrp)). Here are some of the framework's highlights:

- Fast and [portable](#language-bindings) zero dependency [C99 API](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/api-c/)
- Modern type-safe [C++11 API](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/api-cpp/) that doesn't use STL containers
- First open source ECS with full support for [Entity Relationships](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/building-games-in-ecs-with-entity-relationships-657275ba2c6c)!
- Fast native support for [hierarchies](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/relationships-manual/#the-childof-relationship) and [prefabs](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/relationships-manual/#the-isa-relationship)
- Minimal ECS core with optional [addons](#addons)
- Entire codebase builds in less than 5 seconds
- Runs [in the browser](https://flecs.dev/city) without modifications with emscripten
- Cache friendly [archetype/SoA storage](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/building-an-ecs-2-archetypes-and-vectorization-fe21690805f9) that can process millions of entities every frame
- Supports entities with hundreds of components and applications with tens of thousands of archetypes
- Automatic component registration that works out of the box across shared libraries/DLLs
- Write free functions with [queries](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/queries/basics) or run code automatically in [systems](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/systems/pipeline)
- Run games on multiple CPU cores with a fast lockless scheduler
- Compiles warning-free on 8 compilers on all major platforms, with [CI](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/actions) running more than 4000 tests
- Integrated [reflection framework](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/api-meta/) with [JSON serializer](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/basics_json) and support for [runtime components](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/runtime_component)
- [Unit annotations](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/reflection/units) for components
- Powerful [query language](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/rules) with support for [joins](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/rules/setting_variables) and [inheritance](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/tree/master/examples/cpp/rules/component_inheritance)
- [Statistics addon](https://flecs.docsforge.com/master/api-stats/) for profiling ECS performance
- A web-based dashboard ([demo](https://flecs.dev/explorer), [code](https://github.com/flecs-hub/explorer)) for inspecting entities, running ECS queries and monitoring games:

**Flecs v3 is the latest, most stable and feature rich version of Flecs, and recommended for new projects.**

- Latest v3 release: [Flecs v3.0.2-beta](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/releases/tag/v3.0.2-beta).
- Latest v2 release: [Flecs v2.4.8](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs/releases/tag/v2.4.8).

## What is an Entity Component System?
ECS is a new way of organizing code and data that lets you build games that are larger, more complex and are easier to extend.

Something is called an ECS when it:
- Has _entities_ that uniquely identify objects in a game
- Has _components_ which are datatypes that can be added to entities
- Has _systems_ which are functions that run for all entities matching a component _query_

For example, a game has a `Move` _system_ that has a _query_ with two _components_, `Position, Velocity`. When the system is ran it is dynamically matched with all _entities_ that have at least these two components.

For more info on ECS, check the [ECS FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq)!

## Getting Started
To use Flecs, add the [flecs.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.c) and [flecs.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.h) files to your project. When importing the files into a C++ project, make sure to compile [flecs.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.c) as C code (for example by using `gcc` and `clang` instead of `g++` and `clang++`).

Flecs can also be built as a standalone library, by using the cmake, meson, bazel or [bake](https://github.com/SanderMertens/bake) build files. If you are using a custom build file to compile Flecs as a library, make sure to define `flecs_EXPORTS`, for example by adding `-Dflecs_EXPORTS` to the compiler command.

If you want to use the [flecs.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.c) and [flecs.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.h) files to build a standalone library, make sure to remove this line from the top of the [flecs.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanderMertens/flecs/master/flecs.h) file:

```c
#define flecs_STATIC
```

By default Flecs includes many features that may not be useful for every project. Builds can be customized to minimize the overhead of the library. See the [Addons](#addons) section for more information on customized builds.

## Show me the code!
C99 example:
```c
typedef struct {
  float x, y;
} Position, Velocity;

void Move(ecs_iter_t *it) {
  Position *p = ecs_field(it, Position, 1);
  Velocity *v = ecs_field(it, Velocity, 2);

  for (int i = 0; i < it->count; i++) {
    p[i].x += v[i].x;
    p[i].y += v[i].y;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  ecs_world_t *ecs = ecs_init();

  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Position);
  ECS_COMPONENT(ecs, Velocity);

  ECS_SYSTEM(ecs, Move, EcsOnUpdate, Position, Velocity);

  ecs_entity_t e = ecs_new_id(ecs);
  ecs_set(ecs, e, Position, {10, 20});
  ecs_set(ecs, e, Velocity, {1, 2});

  while (ecs_progress(ecs, 0)) { }
}
```

Same example in C++11:
```cpp
struct Position {
  float x, y;
};

struct Velocity {
  float x, y;
};

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  flecs::world ecs;

  ecs.system<Position, const Velocity>()
    .each([](Position& p, const Velocity& v) {
      p.x += v.x;
      p.y += v.y;
    });

  auto e = ecs.entity()
    .set([](Position& p, Velocity& v) {
      p = {10, 20};
      v = {1, 2};
    });

  while (ecs.progress()) { }
}
```

## Addons
Flecs has a modular architecture that makes it easy to only build the features you really need. By default all addons are built. To customize a build, first define `FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD`, then add defines for the addons you need. For example:

```c
#define FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD  // Don't build all addons
#define FLECS_SYSTEM        // Build FLECS_SYSTEM
```

Additionally, you can also specify addons to exclude from a build by adding `NO` to the define:

```c
#define FLECS_NO_LOG
```

The following addons can be configured:
