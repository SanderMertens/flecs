/** Set rate filter.

 * Rate filters enable deterministic system execution which cannot be achieved
 * with interval timers alone. For example, if timer A has interval 2.0 and
 * timer B has interval 4.0, it is not guaranteed that B will tick at exactly
 * twice the multiple of A. This is partly due to the indeterministic nature of
 * timers, and partly due to floating point rounding errors. 
 *
 * Rate filters can be combined with timers (or other rate filters) to ensure 
 * that a system ticks at an exact multiple of a tick source (which can be
 * another system). If a rate filter is created with a rate of 1 it will tick
 * at the exact same time as its source.
 *
 * If no tick source is provided, the rate filter will use the frame tick as
 * source, which corresponds with the number of times ecs_progress is called.

 * sources can be read by getting the EcsTickSource component. If the tick
