/** Run a specific system manually.
 * This operation runs a single system manually. It is an efficient way to
 * invoke logic on a set of entities, as manual systems are only matched to
 * tables at creation time or after creation time, when a new table is created.
 *
 * Manual systems are useful to evaluate lists of pre-matched entities at
 * application defined times. Because none of the matching logic is evaluated
 * before the system is invoked, manual systems are much more efficient than
 * manually obtaining a list of entities and retrieving their components.
 *
 * An application may pass custom data to a system through the param parameter.
 * This data can be accessed by the system through the param member in the
 * ecs_iter_t value that is passed to the system callback.
 *
 * Any system may interrupt execution by setting the interrupted_by member in
 * the ecs_iter_t value. This is particularly useful for manual systems, where
 * the value of interrupted_by is returned by this operation. This, in
 * combination with the param argument lets applications use manual systems
 * to lookup entities: once the entity has been found its handle is passed to
 * interrupted_by, which is then subsequently returned.
 *
 * @param world The world.
 * @param system The system to run.
 * @param delta_time The time passed since the last system invocation.
 * @param param A user-defined parameter to pass to the system.
