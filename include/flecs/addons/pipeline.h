/**
 * @file addons/pipeline.h
 * @brief Pipeline module.
 *
 * The pipeline module provides support for running systems automatically and
 * on multiple threads. A pipeline is a collection of tags that can be added to
 * systems. When ran, a pipeline will query for all systems that have the tags
 * that belong to a pipeline, and run them.
 *
 * The module defines a number of builtin tags (EcsPreUpdate, EcsOnUpdate,
 * EcsPostUpdate etc.) that are registered with the builtin pipeline. The
 * builtin pipeline is ran by default when calling ecs_progress(). An
 * application can set a custom pipeline with the ecs_set_pipeline() function.

     * - group_by

     * Take a look at the system manual for a more detailed explanation of
