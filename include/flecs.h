 *
 * You can customize a build by either whitelisting or blacklisting addons. To
 * whitelist addons, first define the FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD macro, which disables
 * all addons. You can then manually select the addons you need by defining
 * their macro, like "FLECS_SYSTEM".
 *
 * To blacklist an addon, make sure to *not* define FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD, and
 * instead define the addons you don't need by defining FLECS_NO_<addon>, for
 * example "FLECS_NO_SYSTEM". If there are any addons that depend on the
 * blacklisted addon, an error will be thrown during the build.
 *
 * Note that addons can have dependencies on each other. Addons will
 * automatically enable their dependencies. To see the list of addons that was
 * compiled in a build, enable tracing before creating the world by doing:

 *
 * The component ids of a type are sorted, which ensures that it doesn't matter
 * in which order components are added to an entity. For example, if adding
 * Position then Velocity would result in type [Position, Velocity], first
 * adding Velocity then Position would also result in type [Position, Velocity].
 *

 * Applications can have multiple worlds, though in most cases will only need

 *
 * If an application has multiple worlds with overlapping components, it is
 * common (though not strictly required) to use the same component ids across
 * worlds, which can be achieved by declaring a global component id variable.
 * To do this in the C API, see the entities/fwd_component_decl example. The
 * C++ API automatically synchronizes component ids between worlds.
 *
 * Component id conflicts between worlds can occur when a world has already used
 * an id for something else. There are a few ways to avoid this:
 *
 * - Ensure to register the same components in each world, in the same order.
 * - Create a dummy world in which all components are preregistered which
 *   initializes the global id variables.
 *
 * In some use cases, typically when writing tests, multiple worlds are created
 * and deleted with different components, registered in different order. To
 * ensure isolation between tests, the C++ API has a `flecs::reset` function
 * that forces the API to ignore the old component ids. */

/** Begin readonly mode.

 * optimizations that certain aspects of the world to not change, while also 
 * providing a mechanism for applications to prevent accidental mutations in, 
 * for example, multithreaded applications.
 * 
 * Readonly mode is a stronger version of deferred mode. In deferred mode
 * ECS operations such as add/remove/set/delete etc. are added to a command 
 * queue to be executed later. In readonly mode, operations that could break
 * scheduler logic (such as creating systems, queries) are also disallowed.
 * 
 * Readonly mode itself has a single threaded and a multi threaded mode. In
 * single threaded mode certain mutations on the world are still allowed, for 
 * example:
 * - Entity liveliness operations (such as new, make_alive), so that systems are
 *   able to create new entities.
 * - Implicit component registration, so that this works from systems
 * - Mutations to supporting data structures for the evaluation of uncached 
 *   queries (filters), so that these can be created on the fly.
 * 
 * These mutations are safe in a single threaded applications, but for
 * multithreaded applications the world needs to be entirely immutable. For this
 * purpose multi threaded readonly mode exists, which disallows all mutations on
 * the world. This means that in multi threaded applications, entity liveliness
 * operations, implicit component registration, and on-the-fly query creation
 * are not guaranteed to work.
 * 
 * While in readonly mode, applications can still enqueue ECS operations on a
 * stage. Stages are managed automatically when using the pipeline addon and 
 * ecs_progress(), but they can also be configured manually as shown here:
 * 
 * @code
 * // Number of stages typically corresponds with number of threads
 * ecs_set_stage_count(world, 2);
 * ecs_stage_t *stage = ecs_get_stage(world, 1);
 *
 * ecs_readonly_begin(world);
 * ecs_add(world, e, Tag); // readonly assert
 * ecs_add(stage, e, Tag); // OK
 * @endcode
 * 
 * When an attempt is made to perform an operation on a world in readonly mode,
 * the code will throw an assert saying that the world is in readonly mode.
 * 
 * A call to ecs_readonly_begin() must be followed up with ecs_readonly_end().
 * When ecs_readonly_end() is called, all enqueued commands from configured 
 * stages are merged back into the world. Calls to ecs_readonly_begin() and
 * ecs_readonly_end() should always happen from a context where the code has
 * exclusive access to the world. The functions themselves are not thread safe.
 * 
 * In a typical application, a (non-exhaustive) call stack that uses 
 * ecs_readonly_begin() and ecs_readonly_end() will look like this:
 * 
 * @code
 * ecs_progress()
 *   ecs_readonly_begin()
 *     ecs_defer_begin()

 * an application wants to find a component for either the provided table or a
 * prefab (using the `IsA` relationship) of that table, it could use the operation
 * like this:
 *
 * @code
 * int32_t index = ecs_search_relation(

 *   ecs_id(Position), // the component id
 *   EcsIsA,           // the relationship to traverse
 *   0,                // start at depth 0 (the table itself)
 *   0,                // no depth limit
 *   NULL,             // (optional) entity on which component was found
 *   NULL,             // see above
 *   NULL);            // internal type with information about matched id
 * @endcode
 *
 * The operation searches depth first. If a table type has 2 `IsA` relationships, the
 * operation will first search the `IsA` tree of the first relationship.
 *
 * When choosing between ecs_search(), ecs_search_offset() and ecs_search_relation(),
 * the simpler the function the better its performance.
