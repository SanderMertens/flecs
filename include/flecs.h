/* The following macro's let you customize with which addons Flecs is built.
 * Without any addons Flecs is just a minimal ECS storage, but addons add 
 * features such as systems, scheduling and reflection. If an addon is disabled,
 * it is excluded from the build, so that it consumes no resources. By default
 * all addons are enabled.
 * 
 * You can customize a build by either whitelisting or blacklisting addons. To
 * whitelist addons, first define the FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD macro, which disables
 * all addons. You can then manually select the addons you need by defining
 * their macro, like "FLECS_SYSTEM".
 * 
 * To blacklist an addon, make sure to *not* define FLECS_CUSTOM_BUILD, and
 * instead define the addons you don't need by defining FLECS_NO_<addon>, for
 * example "FLECS_NO_SYSTEM". If there are any addons that depend on the 
 * blacklisted addon, an error will be thrown during the build.
 * 
 * Note that addons can have dependencies on each other. Addons will 
 * automatically enable their dependencies. To see the list of addons that was
 * compiled in a build, enable tracing before creating the world by doing:
 *   ecs_log_set_level(0);
 * which outputs the full list of addons Flecs was compiled with.

/** A poly object.
 * A poly (short for polymorph) object is an object that has a variable list of
 * capabilities, determined by a mixin table. This is the current list of types
 * in the flecs API that can be used as an ecs_poly_t:
 * 
 * - ecs_world_t
 * - ecs_stage_t
 * - ecs_query_t
 * - ecs_filter_t
 * - ecs_rule_t
 * - (more to come)
 * 
 * Functions that accept an ecs_poly_t argument can accept objects of these
 * types. If the object does not have the requested mixin the API will throw an
 * assert.
 * 
 * The poly/mixin framework enables partially overlapping features to be
 * implemented once, and enables objects of different types to interact with
 * each other depending on what mixins they have, rather than their type
 * (in some ways it's like a mini-ECS). Additionally, each poly object has a
 * header that enables the API to do sanity checking on the input arguments.

 * Queries should be created once, and reused multiple times. While iterating a
 * query is a cheap operation, creating and deleting a query is expensive. The
 * reason for this is that queries are "prematched", which means that a query
 * stores state about which entities (or rather, tables) match with the query.
 * Building up this state happens during query creation.
 *
 * Once a query is created, matching only happens when new tables are created.
 * In most applications this is an infrequent process, since it only occurs when
 * a new combination of components is introduced. While matching is expensive,
 * it is importent to note that matching does not happen on a per-entity basis,
 * but on a per-table basis. This means that the average time spent on matching
 * per frame should rapidly approach zero over the lifetime of an application.
 *
 * A query provides direct access to the component arrays. When an application
 * creates/deletes entities or adds/removes components, these arrays can shift
 * component values around, or may grow in size. This can cause unexpected or
 * undefined behavior to occur if these operations are performed while 
 * iterating. To prevent this from happening an application should either not
 * perform these operations while iterating, or use deferred operations (see
 * ecs_defer_begin and ecs_defer_end).

/** Search for component/relation id in table type starting from an offset.

 * an application wants to find a component for either the provided table or a
 * prefab (using the IsA relation) of that table, it could use the operation 
 * like this:
 * 
 * int32_t index = ecs_search_relation(

 *   table,            // the table

 *   ecs_id(Position), // the component id
 *   EcsIsA,           // the relation to traverse
 *   0,                // start at depth 0 (the table itself)

 *   NULL,             // see above
 *   NULL);            // internal type with information about matched id
 * 
 * The operation searches depth first. If a table type has 2 IsA relations, the
 * operation will first search the IsA tree of the first relation.
